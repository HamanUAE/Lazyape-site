# LazyApe Reboot — Static Site
This is a ready-to-deploy static site for **GitHub Pages**.

## How to use
1) Put your assets in `assets/`:
   - `lazyape_bg.jpg` — background image (tropical sunset)
   - `lazyape_chimp.png` — mascot PNG (transparent background)
   - `whitepaper.pdf` — your whitepaper

2) Edit links in `index.html` if needed (Presale, Telegram, Notion).

3) Deploy on GitHub Pages:
   - Create a repo, push these files.
   - Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/ (root)`.
   - Wait 1–2 minutes. Your site will be live.

## Notes
- The hero section shows the background and places the chimp at the bottom.
- Works well on mobile & desktop.
